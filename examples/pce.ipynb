The result is a direct surrogate model that can be used to estimate time of event given a loading profile, without requiring the original model to be simulated. The resulting estimation is MUCH faster than simulating the model.\n",

    "This functionality is especially useful in cases where you need to evaluate a large number of loading profiles in a short amount of time or with limited computational resources. For example, when you would like to optimize a loading profile. In that case, it would not make sense to have a state-transition model in the inner loop of the optimization, since the state transition model would be called many times. Instead, you can use a direct surrogate model to estimate time of event directly from the loading profile."

    "## `PolynomialChaosExpansion` Class Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PolynomialChaosExpansion](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_models/DataModel.html#polynomialchaosexpansion) class inherits from the [DataModel](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_models/DataModel.html#datamodel) class. It's used to generate a polynomial chaos expansion from data or a model to learn the relationship between future inputs and time of event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PolynomialChaosExpansion` class takes the following arguments in its constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `models`: A list of Polynomial chaos expansion models (one for each event).\n",
    "- `times`: A list of times to use for the polynomial chaos expansion.\n",
    "- `input_keys`: A list of input keys for the inputs.\n",
    "- `event_keys`: An optional list of event keys for the events. If not provided, they will be generated as e0, e1, e2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The class has the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__init__(self, models, times, input_keys, **kwargs)`: Initializes the `PolynomialChaosExpansion` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `time_of_event(self, x, future_loading_eqn, **kwargs)`: Predicts the time of event for future inputs. Returns a dictionary where keys are event keys and values are results from the polynomial chaos expansion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [from_data](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_models/DataModel.html#prog_models.data_models.PolynomialChaosExpansion.from_data)`(cls, times, inputs, time_of_event, input_keys, **kwargs)`: Class method that creates a `PolynomialChaosExpansion` object from data. It trains the polynomial chaos expansion using the provided inputs and time of event data. Returns a `PolynomialChaosExpansion` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [from_model](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_models/DataModel.html#prog_models.data_models.PolynomialChaosExpansion.from_model)`(cls, m, x, input_dists, times, **kwargs)`: Class method that creates a `PolynomialChaosExpansion` object from a model. It trains the polynomial chaos expansion using the provided model and initial state. Returns a `PolynomialChaosExpansion` object.\n",
