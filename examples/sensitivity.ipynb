    "Sensitivity analysis is a method used to understand how different values of an independent variable will impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions. This technique is used within specific boundaries that depend on one or more input variables, such as the effect that changes in interest rates have on bond prices.\n",

    "In the context of a prognostic model, sensitivity analysis can help to understand how changes in model parameters or inputs affect the model's predictions. This is particularly useful for understanding the robustness of the model's predictions in the face of uncertainties in the model parameters or inputs."
