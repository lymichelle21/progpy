    "In the `CentrifugalPumpBase` class of ProgPy, wear rates play a significant role in modeling the degradation and eventual failure of different components of the pump. These rates represent how quickly different parts of the pump wear down or degrade over time due to operation. Here's a closer look at each wear rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wA`: This wear rate corresponds to the impeller area (`A`). It represents how quickly the impeller area degrades or wears down over time. <span style=\"color:teal\">The impeller is a crucial part of the pump as it imparts energy to the fluid, and wear on the impeller can affect the pump's efficiency and flow rate.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wRadial`: This wear rate is associated with the radial friction coefficient (`rRadial`). It represents how quickly friction in the radial bearings increases over time. <span style=\"color:teal\">The radial bearings support the weight of the shaft and impeller, and increased friction can lead to increased heat and wear on these components, potentially leading to bearing failure.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wThrust`: This wear rate pertains to the rolling friction coefficient (`rThrust`). It signifies how quickly friction in the thrust bearings increases over time. <span style=\"color:teal\">The thrust bearings help balance axial forces in the pump, and increased friction can lead to overheating and wear, potentially resulting in bearing failure.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "These wear rates are incorporated into the model's state update equations, allowing the model to simulate not just the pump's behavior under normal operating conditions, but also how its performance will degrade over time due to wear. This makes the model a powerful tool for predicting when the pump might fail and planning maintenance to prevent such failures."
